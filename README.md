Nodz is a very user friendly python library to create nodes based graphs. It can be connected to anything you want as long as it understands python. Nodz does not hold any data other than its own graphics and attributes types as it is used by the graphics. Nods provides you with a very simple way to read your graph, it outputs connections as strings ('Node1.attribute1', 'node2.attribute5')

Nodz is partially customizable via a configuration file that let you change colors and the shape of nodes.

EDIT: 10Jan2022 Tjtr33 changes made for use with Linuxcnc Hal components ( like nodes ) I am not a professional software developer. Apologies for not understanding the program as delivered, not understanding Python, and not understanding GIT. Please look at the 3 json files SaveMe01... SaveMe02... SaveMe03... run the app 'python nodz_demo.py' ( I use python 2.7 and will update code to 3 soon ) Load these files to see how Nodz works with LinuxCNC informations.

The file creation flow: The LinuxCNC hal files are loaded into LinuxCNC. Then a command is issued to collect all the nodes and connections. halcmd show sig > mysystem.signals The file mysystem.signals is processed into json for Nodes. The tool to convert mysystem.signals into mysystem.json is not uploaded yet ( I suppose that will be a new git repo... )

For the meantime you can see and play with the supplied json files.

Enjoy, tjtr33

If you find any errors/bugs/flaws or anything bad, feel free to let me know so I can fix it for the next persons that would like to download nodz. EDIT: tjtr33 i suppose you can contact me thru github, i dunno

PLEASE MAKE SURE TO CREATE 1 PULL REQUEST PER ISSUE ! THIS IS EASIER AND CLEANER TO PROCESS

Nodz in under the MIT license.

WATCH DEMO HERE EDIT: tjtr33 a new video is coming

EDIT: L to load
S to save
"+" to zoom in
"-" to zoom out
ctrl shift meta left mouse in blank area to select ALL
double left mouse click in empty space to deselect ALL
control shift left mouse drag to select am area/group
F to zoom to selected nodes
F to zoom all ( if nothing selected yet, then ALL will be zoomed )
R to get back to original zoom
hover to discover object name and type
click on a bezier net to delete it
left mouse drag from a PLUG to a SOCKET
when a new bezier is dragged near acceptable sockets, they highlight
Requirement

The following needs to be installed!

    pip
    pipenv

Installation

    git clone
    cd location
    pipenv install
    enjoy! :)

Configuration file

Nodz comes with a default configuration file, it is specified what can be removed and what can't be. If this file stays in the default location, it is auto loaded BUT you still need to apply it to Nodz (look at nodz_demo.py lines 5/6) Be careful when editing it, if you are missing a "," it will error. So don't screw up. smile
Features

Nodz comes by default with few features, you can toggle the grid visibility and the auto snap mode + some hotkeys. Hotkeys are at the moment based on Autodesk Maya because I developped this library for my personnal use in this specific software but I'm planning on adding that part in the configuration file so everyone can set different hotkeys.

nodz.gridVisToggle = True
nodz.gridSnapToggle = False

del : delete the selected nodes
f   : zoom focus on selected items, all the items if nothing is selected
s   : snap the selected node on the grid

API

Nodz has a very simple API of 12 methods. For more information on each method, please read nodz_main.py as it has all the documentation required.

Initialize

def loadConfig(filePath=defautConfigPath)
def initialize()

Nodes

def createNode(name, preset, position, alternate)
def deleteNode(node)
def editNode(node, newName)

Attributes

def createAttribute(node, name, index, preset, plug, socket, dataType, plugMaxConnections, socketMaxConnections)
def deleteAttribute(node, index)
def editAttribute( node, index, newName, newIndex)

Connections

def createConnection(sourceNode, sourceAttr, targetNode, targetAttr)

Graph

def saveGraph(filePath)
def loadGraph(filePath)
def evaluateGraph()
def clearGraph()

Signals

Nodz also offers you some signals, most of them can feel redundant considering the design of the library but I'm sure some of you will find a use for it. It's better to have them just in case than not having them. They are absolutly not mandatory in order for nodz to work.

Nodes

signal_NodeCreated(nodeName)
signal_NodeDeleted([nodeNames])
signal_NodeEdited(oldName, newName)
signal_NodeSelected([nodeNames])
signal_NodeMoved(nodeName, nodePos)
signal_NodeDoubleClicked(nodeName)

Attributes

signal_AttrCreated(nodeName, attrIndex)
signal_AttrDeleted(nodeName, attrIndex)
signal_AttrEdited(nodeName, oldIndex, newIndex)

Connections

signal_PlugConnected(srcNodeName, plugAttribute, dstNodeName, socketAttribue)
signal_PlugDisconnected(srcNodeName, plugAttribute, dstNodeName, socketAttribue)
signal_SocketConnected(srcNodeName, plugAttribute, dstNodeName, socketAttribue)
signal_SocketDisconnected(srcNodeName, plugAttribute, dstNodeName, socketAttribue)

Graph

signal_GraphSaved()
signal_GraphLoaded()
signal_GraphCleared()

View

signal_KeyPressed(key)
signal_Dropped(drop position)
