Menu Guide Notes for Nodz4hal

------what it does -----------------------------
Nodz4Hal will use info about a linuxcnc configuration to make a
di-graph( directed graph ). This program can make it easier to 
understand what the .hal (and other ) files ask LinuxCNC to do.
I think lengthy .hal files are difficult to imagine, so I used 
Nodz by LeGoffLoic to build these graphs.

-----------initial workflow  neccesary to begin------
  Run LinuxCNC
  Open a terminal and type
    cd
    cd <path/to/Nodz4hal>
    halcmd show sig > myfile.signals
    python3 nodz_demo.py
    C
    using file selector, open myfi;e.signals
    create a filename to save the converted information   mynodz
    L
    pen the file mynodz.jsn ( .json was automatically added )
    you now have a rats nest diagram of your system with all nets 
    drag the nodes( boxes ) with most nets closer to each other
    drag nodes with only one output toward left of the connected node
    continue moving nodes until it makes sense to you (the creator)
    S
    save the file ( pick the name from the list , agree to overwrite )
    exit Nodz4Hal, exit Linuxcnc
    You now can run Nodz4Hal and continue editing when you like.
    
------choose your editor------------------------
Edit the very top of default_config.json to use your preferred editor.
I chose SCiTE so mine looks like this
"""
{
    // your choice of editor
    "chosen_editor": "scite",
    // General > Edit values BUT do not delete.

"""
You will use your editor to untwist the nets in the rat's nest 

----------commands -------------------------------
interaction uses keys and mouse

undo?    doesnt exist, so save often

quit     the X btn in top right of window

change window size   as you like, but a 'L' or 'l' or 'F' will make it look nicer

key/mouse mod1  mod2 mod2 type    where        action
    left  shift ctrl meta clk     space  select everything                  
    left                  clk     space  de-select everything               

    left  shift           drag    space  lasoo nodes and thier nets
    left                  drag    area   drag selection, drop when done

    right                 clk     net    delete net( happens on release )
    left                  drag    '>'    drag a net, drop on socket

    left  shift ctrl      dbl clk node   edit the main file
    left                  dbl clk ShowMe display linked hypermedia   

    middle           alt  drag    any    Pan scene  
    
M/m                                      view menu in editor    
L                                        loads a graph
l                                        loads a view ( a list of nodes )
S                                        saves a graph (appends .json)
s                                        saves a view ( appends .json )
F                                        fits selected nodes in view
R                                        restore original scaling 
+                                        zoom in
-                                        zoom out

--------------------- suggestion for storing files ----------
I suggest a folder for each graph and in it
  in thst directory...
    keep the halcmd show sig file
    a directory of ShowMeTexts fro mcodes, bash perl tcl python scripts fro reference
    a dirctory of ShowMePix for svg's of schmatics, jpegs pngs of hdwr items
    a directory of Views to store and retrieve views
