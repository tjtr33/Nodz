#27jan0202 tiny gap between bezier and left side of socket 'fixed'
#  likely the calc of painterpath (bez bound box) is rt shifted this amount
#
# i made some halcmd shoe pin > compname.pins   files
# thinking this was beginning of build graph from scratch
# what doe sit take to load one ( a one comp graph w/o nets )
# 
#24jan2022 22:37 V(iew) from a list of node names works ok
#  when nodes are jammed against top left, not so pretty
#  may need to add a border value when saving/creating, else pretty good
# TODO adda view file save, view file load
#  how to save ? 
# see this SO answer for using json in and out
#https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27745500/how-to-save-a-list-to-a-file-and-read-it-as-a-list-type
#  i tried in a terminal and worked well
# saving should just save a list of quoted names ["fred","ethel","lucy", "ricky"]
# loading should just read and set rect and focus on rect
#  prelim dlog for "load or save" ??
#  never did a dlog yet
#TODO theres a bug in the selected area code,
# one example fails ... gvLoThreshold, gv2offset13.0  
#   fuzzy idea prob is cuz 2nd item is way above 1st, maybe subtract is ng here
#   if all nodes in between are in list, then ok
#   if i skip in between then ng
#   IF user lassoos the area to view, then the problem doesnt show
#
#24jan2022 arrgh did i break hypermedia? 
#  i can still get editor w ^shift left clk on node
#  phew! ability still there, i hadnet edited in the hypermedia infos  for fname and datattype
#  NB to get hypermedia  jut dnl clk on ShowMe
#  NB to get editor  use ^ShiftLeftClick on node ( use the yellow bar else you clkd on a slot not node )
#
# TODO the saving of views
#  should save just the node names to fill the screen
#  not the whole scene pre-zoomed to those nodes
#  so search selected...
#   xmpl     for item in self.scene().items(painterPath):
#                item.setSelected(True)
#
# ALSO
#  after save all, the nets are disconnected until a node gets moved, even a tiny bit
#  
#24jan2022
# YAY now using RTPRESS will del net so normal dragging zoomed out is ok
# normal LFPRESS will NOT del nets
# chg made in class ConnectionItem func mouseReleaseEvent
# ...
#       #24jan make action conditional with button() == 2 (rt btn)
#	if(event.button() == QtCore.Qt.RightButton):
#...
#24jan also had to rem out whole bottom of code
#   class ConnectionItem func mousePressEvent
#  else  ANY btn press would delete a net
#  i think safe to have just 1 event path from deleting a net
#  now (24jan2022) rtbtn press on net == delete
#  TODO CLEANUP
#
#22jan cntd look at why F doesnt fit selected nodes into a window that 'just' envelopes those nodes
# 1) the action of manually selecting (^shiftMetaLeftPress in space)
#  all then F(ocus) does NOT work always
# 2) the action od deselectall ( l clk in space )
#  then F does NOT work ( code sez if none selected then select all then Focus)
# am i printing the rect of slected or the rect the nodes will be placed into?
# slot on_nodeSelected 
# a new run, load, then F   is FIT and topleft test rect dragged shows ~0 ~-150
#   NOT on all saved scenes!  usually not :-(
#
# beware QrectF is x,y,width,height  NOLT x1,y1,x2,y2
#  this can be seen with any tiny rect, last 2 nums are tiny, 1st 2 depend on loc
#
# the initial load goes into world defined by cfg file ( 0,0,3800,2000 )
# so any element in neg space ( neg X for xmpl ) are not seen ( they are off-screen )
# i think author never expected ned positions
# --- if some nodes are neg x, then lasso all, then F, then some nodes ar eoff screen 
#  --   i must drag whole scene so no nodes are neg
#  --   AND all must fit inside cfg files width/height
# --- manual sel all F is better than auto sel all F
#
# i think a good idea to justify all ( move to positive x and y )
#   i had a file x.json where all were pos, but min was > 1000
#   so i made y.json subrtacting 1000 from evert x position
#    with y.json ... L then F worked 
#    ( had extra space on rt  becuz cfg had 5700 width
#      max x posn was 4381... so 4381+200widgetwidth+100bendybezier=4681
#      so try 4681 in cfg file
#      yes that workls but very much mashed up onto left edge
# Can i begin by making all pos?
#  key P positive... using ... file or dict?
# 
# i think a good idea to save width height in json file NOT in cfg file
#
#21jan 
# re:  the saved view is not what was active when Save issued
#  it is at least left shifted
#
#i need to look at the rect used 'itemsarea'
# i think i need to see the x y posn
# so i can compare 'items area to what i see on screen
# myabe begin with top left  of itemmarea and 
# be able to meta rt clk get xy posn of mouse
#
# if i carefully adjust whole graph so it saves and loads (with sleAll Focus)
#  then i see the rect is...  near 400 right shifted of 0
#  while leftmost node is at left edge ( where i thought 0 would be )
#  bit where i expect 0 is really 371!
#  NB: i also have cfg.jso chgd to width4000 ( was 2000)
#  hmmm retired at width2000 and scene was WAY right shifted  huge blank area to left
#('itemsArea is ', PyQt5.QtCore.QRectF(371.0, 308.0, 3594.0, 1254.0))
#
# at width 4000 or gretaer (tested up to 5000) the leftmst node is left edge
#  AND rightmodt is right edge, so > 4000 not usedfull
#  and <4000 moves all nodes towards right, leaving empty space on left
#
# why 4000?   becuz actual itemArea is ~3600 plus inherent 400 error?
#  so its some way other value for other graphs?
#
# theres something with visible...
# if some nodes off screen, and i select all and focus
#   then all is not seen
# if all is visible on screen, say really small up and left on screen
#   then slecte all, focus  will zoom to all
#
#if i am close to ctr and zoomed WAY in,
# (like zoomed in till theres only grey space on screen )
# then ^shiftMetaLeftClkInSpace selectall, Focus works
#
# if not on screne ctr, but on some node ctr zoomed way in ( but can clk on space)
# then selectAll Focus 'works', the zoomed view is ALL but ctrd on clk spot
#  not all nodes are seen
#20jan 2300  
# idea: the views... 
#  if i had a list of the components in the view
#  and the unzoomed layout was 'pleasant'
# then i select the nodes in the list
#   and do a F(ocus) command
# well its a good idea, but Focus deosnt work well
#  same general problem as zoom and pan
#
#15jan 10am i saw that ctrl shift l press on node ( near ShowMe)
# was no reliable in getting scite o open SaveMe file from startup
# now Noon it seems to always work !?!?
#
#14jan almost done restoring and cleaning
#  after that get the editing func back ?? ctrl l dblclk on node??
#14jan reduce comments, try to better understand signals and slots
# 14jan i restored all orig slots and .connects
#       in case i trampled on something handy
#
#14jan ctrl shift l clk on a node 
#  will toggle teh node's select state
#  not clean! sometime takes 2 ctl shift l clk before node outline goes orange
#  also the node will become sel'd but wont de-sel w further ctl shift l press-es
#   ( node toggles on but wont not off )
